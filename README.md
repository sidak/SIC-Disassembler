# SIC Disassembler

SIC or Simplified Instructional Computer is a hypothetical machine introduced by Leland L. Beck and D. Manjula for 
their book on System Software. This has an advantage of simple architecture and instruction set making it possible 
for students to understand the details of construction of system software.

The objective of this project is to create a C++ program to disassemble a given SIC object file and create the
corresponding Assembly File. 

## Instructions for Compilation

The compilation process is similar to the way one compiles any C++ program. If you don't have `g++` on 
your system, use the following command to install it.

`sudo apt-get install g++`

Then run the following command for compilation.

`g++ sic_disassembler.cpp`

## Usage Syntax

`./a.out input_file output_file`
